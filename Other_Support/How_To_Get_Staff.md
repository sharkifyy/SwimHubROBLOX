# want staff?

- at the moment once The Managers want to hire more staff they will  most likely send a text with a format like this in either staff announcements or normal announcements -> ![image](https://github.com/sharkifyy/SwimHubROBLOX/assets/130886630/a6383695-842d-4399-a4f7-427873c22686)
# if not then it'll be either google docs/Dyno Docs.

- if it is the DM ```Said Staff``` then dm that ```said staff``` saying "i wanna apply", or "i would like to become support" and don't rush them. after that they will continue with the 2nd process. no more info will be shared..
